CSS (CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets) is used to give Styles and different Colours.

## JavaScript
JavaScript is used to by taking the input from user and give out by using eval funtion,The eval() is a function property of the global object. The argument of the eval() function is a string. It will evaluate the source string as a script body, which means both statements and expressions are allowed. It returns the completion value of the code.

For Eg :

let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let text = "x * y";
let result = eval(text);
```
